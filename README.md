## Installation
Our code is based on PyTorch 1.8.1, torchvision==0.9.1, CUDA 10.1 and Python 3.7. It may work with other versions.

Please also install the following Python dependencies:

```
matplotlib
opencv-python
plyfile
'trimesh>=2.35.39,<2.35.40'
'networkx>=2.2,<2.3'
scipy
```

Please install `pointnet2` layers by running

```
cd third_party/pointnet2 && python setup.py install
```

Please install a Cythonized implementation of gIOU for faster training.
```
conda install cython
cd utils && python cython_compile.py build_ext --inplace
```

## Dataset preparation

To achieve the OV setting, we re-organize the original [ScanNet](https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet/tree/main/scannet) and [SUN RGB-D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet/tree/main/sunrgbd) and adopt annotations of more categories. Please directly download the ov-setting datasets we provide here: [OV SUN RGB-D](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ycaobd_connect_ust_hk/EqeHrtMq5aZBmnZUR79vub4B9HZIBxYLd5K7z6VuvemHzg?e=e7ooDv) and [OV ScanNet](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ycaobd_connect_ust_hk/EsqoPe7-VFxOlY0a-v1-vPwBSiEHoGRTgK5cLIhnjyXiEQ?e=jY7nKT). You can also easily download them by running:
```
bash data_download.sh
```

Then run for the downloaded *.tar file:
```
bash data_preparation.sh
```

## Evaluation
Download the pretrained models [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fTKX1ML5u8jJ249GwAYqdCZGs941907H/view?usp=drive_link).
Then run:
```
bash test_release_models.sh
```

## Training
```
bash scripts/coda_sunrgbd_stage1.sh
bash scripts/coda_sunrgbd_stage2.sh
```
## Running Samples
```
bash run_samples.sh
```
